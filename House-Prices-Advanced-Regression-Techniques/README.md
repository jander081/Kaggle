This notebook is mainly oriented towards ML workflow using sklearn pipelines. In order to modify certain transformers for pipeline use, techniques from http://flennerhag.com/2017-01-08-Recursive-Override/ are used and can be viewed in the attached supporting_files. Models were modified slightly to include baysian optimizers with mixed results. You can find additional notebooks and documents in this repository.
