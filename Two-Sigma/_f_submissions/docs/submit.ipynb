    "within the Python environment. In this competition, you must predict a signed confidence value, y^ti∈[−1,1] , which is multiplied by the market-adjusted return of a given `assetCode` over a ten day window. If you expect a stock to have a large positive return--compared to the broad market--over the next ten days, you might assign it a large, positive `confidenceValue` (near 1.0). If you expect a stock to have a negative return, you might assign it a large, negative `confidenceValue` (near -1.0). If unsure, you might assign it a value near zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each day in the evaluation time period, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{t} = \\sum_{i}\\hat y_{ti}r_{ti}u_{ti}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where rti is the 10-day market-adjusted leading return for day t for instrument i, and uti is a 0/1 `universe` variable (see the data description for details) that controls whether a particular asset is included in scoring on a particular day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission score is then calculated as the mean divided by the standard deviation of your daily xt values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$score = \\frac{\\bar x_{t}}{\\sigma(x_{t})}.$$\n",

    "### Market data\n",
    "Market data\n",
    "The data includes a subset of US-listed instruments. The set of included instruments changes daily and is determined based on the amount traded and the availability of information. This means that there may be instruments that enter and leave this subset of data. There may therefore be gaps in the data provided, and this does not necessarily imply that that data does not exist (those rows are likely not included due to the selection criteria).\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketdata contains a variety of returns calculated over different timespans. All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another).\n",
    "- Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument.\n",
    "- Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons.\n",
    "- Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the marketdata, you will find the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- time(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - the current time (in marketdata, all rows are taken at 22:00 UTC)\n",
    "- assetCode(object) - a unique id of an asset\n",
    "- assetName(category) - the name that corresponds to a group of assetCodes. These may be \"Unknown\" if the corresponding assetCode does not have any rows in the news data.\n",
    "- universe(float64) - a boolean indicating whether or not the instrument on that day will be included in scoring. This value is not provided outside of the training data time period. The trading universe on a given date is the set of instruments that are avilable for trading (the scoring function will not consider instruments that are not in the trading universe). The trading universe changes daily.\n",
    "- volume(float64) - trading volume in shares for the day\n",
    "- close(float64) - the close price for the day (not adjusted for splits or dividends)\n",
    "- open(float64) - the open price for the day (not adjusted for splits or dividends)\n",
    "- returnsClosePrevRaw1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n",

    "- returnsOpenPrevMktres10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n",
    "- returnsOpenNextMktres10(float64) - 10 day, market-residualized return. This is the target variable used in competition scoring. The market data has been filtered such that returnsOpenNextMktres10 is always not null.\n",

    "- urgency(int8) - differentiates story types (1: alert, 3: article)\n",

    "- provider(category) - identifier for the organization which provided the news item (e.g. RTRS for Reuters News, BSW for Business Wire)\n",
    "- subjects(category) - topic codes and company identifiers that relate to this news item. Topic codes describe the news item's subject matter. These can cover asset classes, geographies, events, industries/sectors, and other types.\n",
    "- audiences(category) - identifies which desktop news product(s) the news item belongs to. They are typically tailored to specific audiences. (e.g. \"M\" for Money International News Service and \"FB\" for French General News Service)\n",
    "- bodySize(int32) - the size of the current version of the story body in characters\n",
    "- companyCount(int8) - the number of companies explicitly listed in the news item in the subjects field\n",

    "- relevance(float32) - a decimal number indicating the relevance of the news item to the asset. It ranges from 0 to 1. If the asset is mentioned in the headline, the relevance is set to 1. When the item is an alert (urgency == 1), relevance should be gauged by firstMentionSentence instead.\n",
    "- sentimentClass(int8) - indicates the predominant sentiment class for this news item with respect to the asset. The indicated class is the one with the highest probability.\n",

    "- sentimentWordCount(int32) - the number of lexical tokens in the sections of the item text that are deemed relevant to the asset. This can be used in conjunction with wordCount to determine the proportion of the news item discussing the asset.\n",
    "- noveltyCount12H(int16) - The 12 hour novelty of the content within a news item on a particular asset. It is calculated by comparing it with the asset-specific text over a cache of previous news items that contain the asset.\n",
